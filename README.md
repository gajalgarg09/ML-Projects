# Overview
Sonar is often used in underwater exploration and military applications. In this project, we use sonar signal data to classify objects as rocks or mines (like submarines or other metallic objects).
The objective is to develop and evaluate a classification model using machine learning techniques.

# About the Dataset
The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset.
It contains:

208 samples (rows) <br>
60 features (columns), representing sonar signal strength at different frequencies.  <br>
1 target column, where:  <br>
Rock: The object is a rock.  <br>
Mine: The object is a metallic mine.
